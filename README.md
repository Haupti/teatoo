lets see what this is gonna be

## bugs

* comments at the end of a line are apparently not ignored only on start of a line...

## Future plans

implement these functions
* POW (<arg>) -- checks if a value is [0] returns [1] if so, [0] if not
* EMPTY? -- checks if the scopes stack is empty returns [1] if so, [0] if not
* NULL? <arg> -- checks if the given thing is NULL
* something that executes a sequence in a scope (to have something like 'arguments to a function')
